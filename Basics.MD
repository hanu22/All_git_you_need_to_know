### Using gitignore

* Tracked – These are all the files or directories Git knows about. These are the files and directories newly staged (added with git add) and committed (committed with git commit) to the main repo.
* Untracked – These are any new files or directories created in the working directory but that have not yet been staged (or added using the git add command).
* Ignored – These are all the files or directories that Git knows to completely exclude, ignore, and not be aware of in the Git repository. Essentially, this is a way to tell Git which untracked files should remain untracked and never get committed.
